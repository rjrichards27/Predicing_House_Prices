# Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

This repository contains code for team 6's IDS 705 final project. The goal of the project is to predict house prices using housing data for Georgia and California. All of the intial data is in the Data folder, which is all you need to run the repo. While all of our scratch files are in the the Scratch folder. Then the "EDA&Cleaning2" file should be run followed by "Preprocessing3" to generate the needed data, which will be saved to your Data folder. Once those files are run we were interested in testing out different possible models. The different models are in seperate files that are each named according to the models that are run in the file. The final model used was a light gbm model and the model is trained and validated on different groups of data: by state and home type.
